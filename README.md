# Beginners-Codebook
Sup. Abuzar here. Today is a fine day you see so I though why don't I do something resourceful for once instead of wasting my time. Thus I begin my career into something very peace shattering, head scratching and more complex than a labyrinth. JK. I am serious this time, tho I have no idea where to begin. Bismillah, I think html5 is the way to go.
